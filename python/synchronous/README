These are a synchronous binding to the C libfreenect library, written using the
C API where one can retrieve images from the kinect, rather than use the
callback mechanism.

e.g.:

from pykinect import Kinect()
k = Kinect()

while True:
    depths = k.get_depths()
    print depths.timestamp
    print depths[1, 2] # depth of coordinate (1, 2)
    print depths.data # raw data in a tuple

To install:

python setup.py build
python setup.py install # (may require superuser)
