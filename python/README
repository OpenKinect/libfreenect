** Freenect Ctypes Wrapper **
- Brandyn White (bwhite@dappervision.com)

- Description
This wrapper can be used to write Python code to control the Kinect using the Freenect library.  This is simpler than a module as it does not need to be compiled.  The entire freenect library is exposed at the module level including enumerated constants and function pointer wrappers.

- Requirements
Python 2.5+
numpy

- Installation
Compile freenect and then copy the shared library (e.g., .so) along with this module.

- Examples
demo_mp_depth_show: Use matplotlib's imshow command to display the depth image
demo_mp_rgb_show: Use matplotlib's imshow command to display the RGB image
demo_tilt: Uses a thread to grab sensor data while tilting and changing the LED
