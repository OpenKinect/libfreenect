libfreenect
===========

libfreenect is a userspace driver for the Microsoft Kinect.
It runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows and supports

- RGB and Depth Images
- Motors
- Accelerometer
- LED
- Audio

Notice: If you have the newer Kinect v2 (XBox One), use [OpenKinect/libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2) instead.


# Build Instructions

To build libfreenect, you'll need

- [libusb](http://libusb.info) >= 1.0.18 (Windows needs >= 1.0.22)
- [CMake](http://cmake.org) >= 3.12.4
- [python](http://python.org) >= 2.7 or >= 3.3 (only if BUILD_PYTHON=ON or BUILD_PYTHON2=ON or BUILD_PYTHON3=ON or BUILD_REDIST_PACKAGE=OFF)

For the examples, you'll need

- OpenGL   (included with OSX)
- glut     (included with OSX)
- [pthreads-win32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pthreads4w/) (Windows)

## <a name="fetch-build"></a>Fetch & Build

    git clone https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect
    cd libfreenect
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -L .. # -L lists all the project options
    make

    # if you don't have `make` or don't want color output
    # cmake --build .

Use CMake options to control what gets built.
For example, to build the Python wrapper (defaults to system Python):

    cmake .. -DBUILD_PYTHON=ON
    make

Or the Python 3 wrapper:

    cmake .. -DBUILD_PYTHON3=ON
    make


You can specify a build with debug symbols:

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
    # or with optimizations
    # cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo

You can build .deb, .rpm, and/or .tgz packages with `cpack`:

    cmake .. -DBUILD_CPACK_DEB=ON -DBUILD_CPACK_RPM=ON -DBUILD_CPACK_TGZ=ON
    cpack

For audio support, you must upload firmware to the device.
Newer Kinect models may require audio firmware for motor and LED support.
The best method is to [insert firmware at runtime](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/issues/376#issuecomment-41211251) just after calling `freenect_init()`.

Alternately, firmware for Kinect model 1414 can be downloaded automatically by specifying:

    cmake .. -DBUILD_REDIST_PACKAGE=OFF

Note that firmware may not be legal to redistribute in your jurisdiction!

## Install and build instructions via vcpkg
----------------------------------------
You can download and install libfreenect using the vcpkg(https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
    ./vcpkg integrate install
    vcpkg install libfreenect

The libfreenect port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, please create an issue or pull request(https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on the vcpkg repository.

## OSX

If you don't have a package manager, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).
For a manual build, see [the wiki](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_under_OSX).

### Homebrew

    brew install libfreenect
    # or get the very latest:
    # brew install --HEAD libfreenect

### MacPorts

    sudo port install git-core cmake libusb libtool

Continue with [Fetch & Build](#fetch-build).


## Linux

Remember to install the [udev rules](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/platform/linux/udev).
For a manual build, see [the wiki](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Manual_Build_on_Linux).

### Ubuntu/Debian/Mint

The version packaged in Ubuntu may be very old.
To install newer packaged builds, see [the wiki](http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Ubuntu.2FDebian).
Continue with this section for a manual build.

    sudo apt-get install git cmake build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev

    # only if you are building the examples:
    sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev

Continue with [Fetch & Build](#fetch-build).

There is also a [debian branch](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/debian) for packaging purposes.

### Gentoo Linux

There are [dev-libs/libfreenect](https://github.com/piedar/overboard/tree/master/dev-libs/libfreenect) ebuilds in the [overboard repo](https://github.com/piedar/overboard).

### Arch Linux

There is a [libfreenect](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfreenect) PKGBUILD in the AUR.
Alternately, the [libfreenect-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libfreenect-git) PKGBUILD builds the very latest.


## Windows

As of libusb 1.0.22, [libusbK isochronous transfers](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/commit/55ced7746dd697024f2042aca009b7436892bf2b) are now supported natively.  There is no longer a need to compile a custom version of libusb.

Use [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) to install the libusbK driver for each device you wish to use.
Follow [Fetch & Build](#fetch-build) or use Github and CMake GUI tools.
Remember to supply paths to CMake so it can find dependencies.
For example:

    cmake .. -DLIBUSB_1_INCLUDE_DIR="C:\path\to\libusb\include" -DLIBUSB_1_LIBRARY="C:\path\to\libusb\libusb.lib"


# Wrappers

Interfaces to various languages are provided in [wrappers/](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect/tree/master/wrappers).
Wrappers are not guaranteed to be API stable or up to date.

- C (using a synchronous API)
- C++
- C#
- python
- ruby
- actionscript
- Java (JNA)

# Fakenect

Using fakenect, you can record a session to a directory and play it back later.

    mkdir session
    fakenect-record ./session

To use a fakenect recorded stream, just provide the fakenect lib as a pre loaded library with `LD_PRELOAD` and indicates the recorded files directory with `FAKENECT_PATH`.

- Sample with python wrappers :
```shell
    LD_PRELOAD="/usr/local/lib/fakenect/libfakenect.so" FAKENECT_PATH="./session" python ./wrappers/python/demo_cv_sync.py
```
- Sample with C bin :
```shell
    LD_PRELOAD="/usr/local/lib/fakenect/libfakenect.so" FAKENECT_PATH="./session" freenect-glview
```

# Code Contributions
