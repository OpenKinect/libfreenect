Ongoing Development and Maintenance by the OpenKinect Community

- Original Code and Engineering: Hector Martin (marcan)
- Community Lead: Josh Blake (JoshB)
- Integration: Kyle Machulis (qDot)

=== Description

libfreenect is the core library for accessing the Microsoft Kinect USB
camera. Currently, the library supports access to:

- RGB and Depth Images
- Motors
- Accelerometer
- LED

Audio is currently being worked on.

=== Information Resources

=== Requirements

For the driver, you'll need

- libusb-1.0 >= 1.0.3 (*nix and OS X)
- libusb-win32 (Windows)
- Cmake >= 2.6 (All platforms)

For the glview sample, you'll need

- OpenGL
- glut
- pthreads (Either platform provided or pthread-win32 for windows)

For links to the software listed, see http://openkinect.org/wiki/Getting_Started#Dependencies

See the platform specifics section for other information specific to
the platform you may be working on.

=== Basic Compiling Instructions

To use CMake:

- Make a directory somewhere. Like, say, 'build' in your repo directory.
- Go into that directory
- Type cmake ..
- Watch the magic happen
- After this, just run make and you'll be fine.
- If you want to use an IDE or whatever, well, you'll figure it out.

=== Platform Specifics

==== OS X

NOTE: AS OF 2010-11-16, WE HAVE UPDATED THIS PATCH. IF YOU HAVE
ALREADY PATCHED, PLEASE REPATCH AND REINSTALL LIBUSB TO GET OS X
WORKING AT FULL 30FPS.

You will need to pull the matching version of libusb for this
patch. This is NOT v1.0.8, this is a change based off the repo head as
of 2010-10-16. To get a tar.gz with the snapshot of the repo at this
point, hit the link below.

http://git.libusb.org/?p=libusb.git;a=snapshot;h=7da756e09fd97efad2b35b5cee0e2b2550aac2cb;sf=tgz;js=1

Once you've gotten that tarball and unziped it somewhere, patch using
the files in platform/osx/. Just go to the root directory of the
libusb source and run

patch -p1 < [path_to_OpenKinectRepo]/platform/osx/libusb-osx-kinect.diff

You need to tell configure to include some necessary frameworks:
./configure LDFLAGS='-framework IOKit -framework CoreFoundation'

Recompile libusb and put it wherever CMake will look (/usr/local/lib,
/usr/lib, etc...). If you're using a package manager like fink,
macports, or homebrew, I'm going to expect you know what your doing
and can deal with this. If not, see IRC channel.

OpenGL and GLUT come as prebuilt frameworks with OS X, so that should
do it for requirements.

==== Linux

Should "just work" if you have the following packages installed:

- libusb-1.0-dev

If you want to see the glview example:

- freeglut3-dev (or whatever freeglut dev package your distro has)
- libxmu-dev
- libxi-dev

udev rules are available in the platform/linux directory so that you
are not required to run as root.

==== Windows

Windows support is now available in libfreenect. The inf files in the
platform/windows directory can be used for installing the device, and
the library will need libusb-win32 to compile.

==== Wrappers

libfreenect has interface to several languages. Look in the wrappers/
directory for them:

- C (using a synchronous API)
- python
- actionscript
- C#
- Java (JNA)
