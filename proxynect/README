==Description==
Proxynect runs a persistent daemon which controls a single device. Multiple subscribers using the proxynect library can connect to and control the device.

Proxynect allows multiple processes to use the same Kinect, and avoids certain issues related to repeated reinitialization of the Kinect.

==Daemon==
Run the daemon with
./proxydaemon [deviceindex]
If deviceindex is not specified, 0 is assumed. Press Ctrl+C to quit.

The proxydaemon tries to avoid running if another instance seems to be active. Add "--force" to the command-line if you want to override this (e.g. if the last instance did not shutdown properly).

==Library==
Use the resulting proxynect .so dynamically instead of libfreenect.

==Build==
This is built with the main cmake script.

This gives you a build/lib/proxynect/libfreenect.so that you dynamically link in instead of libfreenect.so.

You can call proxynect in front of your application to automatically force the proxynect library to be used, e.g.

proxynect glview

==Credits==
This library is based on the fakenect library by Brandyn White.
