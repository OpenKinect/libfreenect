# clj-openkinect
by John Vlachoyiannis (jon@emotionull.com)

This is a wrapper of the Java libs and I aim to wrap everything :D
So, why a clojure wrapper?

I needed to experiment with Kinect and I ended up compiling and
searching for libs. Also, I am addicted to REPL so I want to
experiment and use the AWESOME clojure libraries and play around.
Do you need more excuses? 

All java jars are copied inside lib so, fire up a lein swank,
your emacs, and there you go!

As you can see, it is still VEEEERY experimental but I am working on it!
