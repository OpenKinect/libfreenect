Commands:
         list  : Display a list of connected devices before starting. 
                 Select the device to use for the test from the list.
         read  : Read from the device.
         write : Write to the device.
         loop  : [Default] Read and write to the device at the same time.

         notestselect : Skips submitting the control transfers to get/set the
                        test type.  This makes the application compatible
                        with non-benchmark firmwared. Use at your own risk!

         verify       : Verify received data for loop and read tests. Report
                        basic information on data validation errors.
         verifydetail : Same as verify except reports detail information for 
                        each byte that fails validation.
                        
Switches:
         vid        : Vendor id of device. (hex)  (Default=0x0666)
         pid        : Product id of device. (hex) (Default=0x0001)
         retry      : Number of times to retry a transfer that timeout.
                      (Default = 0)
         timeout    : Transfer timeout value. (milliseconds) (Default=5000)
                      The timeout value used for read/write operations. If a
                      transfer times out more than {retry} times, the test 
                      fails and the operation is aborted.
         mode       : Sync|Async (Default=Sync) 
                      Sync uses the libusb-win32 sync transfer functions.
                      Async uses the libusb-win32 asynchronous api.
         buffersize : Transfer test size in bytes. (Default=4096)
                      Increasing this value will generally yield higher
                      transfer rates.
         buffercount: (Async mode only) Number of outstanding transfers on
                      an endpoint (Default=1, Max=10). Increasing this value
                      will generally yield higher transfer rates.
         refresh    : The display refresh interval. (in milliseconds)
                      (Default=1000) This also effect the running status.
         priority   : AboveNormal|BelowNormal|Highest|Lowest|Normal
                      (Default=Normal) The thread priority level to use
                      for the test.
         ep         : The loopback endpoint to use. For example ep=0x01, would
                      read from 0x81 and write to 0x01. (default is to use the
                      (first read/write endpoint(s) in the interface)
         intf       : The interface id the read/write endpoints reside in.
         packetsize : For isochronous use only. Sets the iso packet size.
                      If not specified, the endpoints maximum packet size
                      is used.         
WARNING:
          This program should only be used with USB devices which implement
          one more more "Benchmark" interface(s).  Using this application
          with a USB device it was not designed for can result in permanent
          damage to the device.
